### What is Machine Learning ? 

Training a computer/machine to perform an action and give sensible result, without writing every single step as in regular computer programming. 
Generally, learning happens from the data given to the algorithm.
Heart of machine learning involves algorithm, that takes the data - either labeled or unlabeled and makes the decision or prediction. 

Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning are its type. 


Weights: They are variables that keep on changing(updating) as the algorithm learns so as to give the best output possible (minimize the loss/ maximize the accuracy)

Model: Just a fancy term for a program or a main-box(heart) . It takes parameters like weights and biases as an input along with actual input (features), which ultimately determines the performance of the model.

Trained Model: Once the choice of weights and biases becomes suitable for the model to give desired result, it will become the part of the trained model.
The trained model can be thought of as a trained computer program.
